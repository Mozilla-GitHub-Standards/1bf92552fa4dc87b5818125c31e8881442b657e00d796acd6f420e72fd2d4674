# Frequently Asked Questions

Thanks for your interest in Email Tabs. Some questions:

## Mail Providers

### Why does this only support Gmail?

There's no standard for composing rich emails. Email Tabs accomplishes it by doing a kind of simulated copy-and-paste into body of your Gmail message. It also tries to check for a login form, and detects when the email has actually been sent.

All of this functionality is custom built for Gmail. If we want to implement it for another provider we have to recreate that code for another provider.

We are interested in supporting other providers, and have some early support for Yahoo Mail and Outlook.com.

If the experiment is successful we will have to consider how to support other providers.

### I don't use webmail, can Email Tabs support me?

Not really. You can use the Copy Tabs To Clipboard functionality to paste into an email, though we don't support the full set of templates that we support for webmail.

If this would be of interest to you, we welcome your feedback via the add-on, or [team-email-tabs@mozilla.com](mailto:team-email-tabs@mozilla.com).

### What about other mail providers?

Each mail provider requires quite a bit of work to support, and this is currently an experiment. We won't be able to support other providers during the experiment.
